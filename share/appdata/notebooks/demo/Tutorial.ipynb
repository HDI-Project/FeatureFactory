    "*What is feature engineering?* Feature engineering is the step in the data science pipeline in which raw variables are transformed to create features ready for inclusion in a machine learning model. This is a critical step in a typical data science pipeline and can be one of the most challenging aspects of a prediction task. Indeed, human intuition and domain expertise often play a key role in the generation of high-quality features.\n",
