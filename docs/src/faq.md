## Restarting your server

You may want or be asked to restart your notebook server, possibly in order to access bug
fixes. If you follow these instructions, you should be able to do this without loss of any
data or work.

1. *Save all of your notebooks.* Your notebooks should autosave on any changes, but you can
   save them manually to be sure. Press *File -> Save and Checkpoint*.
2. *Stop your server.* Press the *Control Panel* icon at the top right. Press *Stop Server*.
   After a few moments, your server should stop and the button should disappear.
3. *Start your server.* You can now press *My Server* to restart your server.
