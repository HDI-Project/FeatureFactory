    "Feature factory is an online infrastructure that allows one to quickly prototype and test features for different machine learning problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning to use Feature Factory, we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with what IPython Notebook. IPython Notebook is an interactive python kernel that allows you to run code in different cells. Variables created by the code live in the IPython Notebook python kernel and can be accessed at any time, by any cell. More information can be found at http://ipython.org/notebook.html\n",

    "To get started with Feature Factory, please clone the Template notebook. To do this, click \"File\"->\"Make a Copy\". This should spawn a new tab within your browser with the copied notebook. Rename the notebook to your liking and make all edits on that notebook.\n",

    "# Rossman Store Sales Machine Learning Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you are challenged to identify and derive or generate the features which would help the most in making the prediction of 6 weeks of daily sales for the 1,115 stores located across Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in a relational format, split among mutliple files. When using **commands.get_sample_dataset()** to retrieve the dataset, the files are provided as a list of *pandas.DataFrame* objects.\n",

    "The following step-by-step example shows this in detail.\n",

    "### Sales Data\n",

    "The sales table contains information about the sales which each store made each day within the analyzed period along with some information about the store circumstances on that date.\n",
