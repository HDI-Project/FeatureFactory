Jupyter Notebook is an interactive python kernel that allows you to run code in different cells. Variables created by the code live in the Jupyter Notebook python kernel and can be accessed at any time, by any cell. More information can be found [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html)."

    "\n",
    "In this competition, you are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.\n",
