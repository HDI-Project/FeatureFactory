    "Feature factory is an online infrastructure that allows one to quickly prototype and test features for different machine learning problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning to use Feature Factory, we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with what IPython Notebook. IPython Notebook is an interactive python kernel that allows you to run code in different cells. Variables created by the code live in the IPython Notebook python kernel and can be accessed at any time, by any cell. More information can be found at http://ipython.org/notebook.html\n",

    "To get started with Feature Factory, please clone the Template notebook. To do this, click \"File\"->\"Make a Copy\". This should spawn a new tab within your browser with the copied notebook. Rename the notebook to your liking and make all edits on that notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "The persistence of chemicals in the environment (or to environmental inuences) is welcome only until the time the chemicals ful\f",
    "ll their role. After that time or if they happen to be at the wrong place, the chemicals are considered pollutants.\n",
    "In this phase of chemicals' life-span we wish that the chemicals disappear as soon as possible. The most ecologically acceptable (and a very cost-e\u000b",
    "ective) way of 'disappearing' is degradation to components which are not considered pollutants (e.g. mineralization of organic compounds). Degradation in the environment can take several forms, from physical pathways (erosion, photolysis, etc.), through chemical pathways (hydrolysis, oxydation, diverse chemolises, etc.) to biological pathways (biolysis). Usually the pathways are combined and interrelated, thus making degradation even more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study we focus on biodegradation in an aqueous environment under aerobic conditions, which affects the quality of surface and groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you will be given a dataset of chemical properties measured during a study on biodegradation in an aqueous environment under aerobic conditions, in which the water/octanol partition coefficient (LOGP) value of each molecule has been used to classify them into multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are challenged to work with this dataset and attempt to identify and derive or generate the features which would help the most in predicting the logp class of any of the molecules based on the rest of values measured.\n",
