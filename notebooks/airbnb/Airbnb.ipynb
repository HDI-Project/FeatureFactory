    "Feature factory is an online infrastructure that allows one to quickly prototype and test features for different machine learning problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning to use Feature Factory, we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with what IPython Notebook. IPython Notebook is an interactive python kernel that allows you to run code in different cells. Variables created by the code live in the IPython Notebook python kernel and can be accessed at any time, by any cell. More information can be found at http://ipython.org/notebook.html\n",

    "To get started with Feature Factory, please clone the Template notebook. To do this, click \"File\"->\"Make a Copy\". This should spawn a new tab within your browser with the copied notebook. Rename the notebook to your liking and make all edits on that notebook.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of waking to overlooked \"Do not disturb\" signs, Airbnb travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a whimsical treehouse, having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat, or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recruiting competition, Airbnb challenges you to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking. Kagglers who impress with their answer (and an explanation of how they got there) will be considered for an interview for the opportunity to join Airbnb's Data Science and Analytics team.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you are challenged to identify and derive or generate the features which would help the most in predicting in which country a new user will make his or her first booking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you are given a list of USA users along with their demographics, web session records and some summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. Please note that 'NDF' is different from 'other' because 'other' means there was a booking, but is to a country not included in the list, while 'NDF' means there wasn't a booking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in a relational format, split among mutliple files. When using **commands.get_sample_dataset()** to retrieve the dataset, the files are provided as a list of *pandas.DataFrame* objects.\n",
