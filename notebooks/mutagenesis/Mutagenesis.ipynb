    "Before beginning to use Feature Factory, we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is an interactive python kernel that allows you to run code in different cells. Variables created by the code live in the Jupyter Notebook python kernel and can be accessed at any time, by any cell. More information can be found [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html)."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutagenesis is a well-known benchmark machine learning dataset. It comprises 230 molecules trialled for mutagenicity on Salmonella typhimurium. Debnath et al., [2] showed that a subset of 188 molecules are learnable using linear regression. This subset was later termed the ”regression friendly” dataset. The remaining 42 molecules is named the ”regression unfriendly” subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the low intrinsic interest from a machine learning perspective, authors have historically concentrated on the set of 188 molecules (hereafter referred to as the mutagenesis dataset). Of the 188 molecules 125 have positive log mutagenicity whereas 63 molecules have zero or negative log mutagenicity. The molecules with positive log mutagenicity are labelled active and the remaining are labelled inactive. In this way predicting mutagenicity for the molecules is a binary categorization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debanth et al., indicated two chemical features and two indicator features for effective learning. The chemical (C) features are lowest unoccupied molecule orbital (LUMO), water/octanol partition coefficient (LOGP) whereas the other two features are pre-coded structural (PS) attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Srinivasan et al., [1] encoded structural features of the molecules using first-order logic. The key information is given in the form of atom and bond (AB) description. Atom and bond description is used to define functional groups (FG) including methyl groups, nitro groups, aromatic rings, hetero-aromatic rings, connected rings, ring length and benzene rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you are challenged to work with this dataset and attempt to identify and derive or generate the features which would help the most in predicting whether a particular molecule will be active or inactive.\n",
